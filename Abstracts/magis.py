{task}

You have a team of three workers:
* repository_custodian: Considering extensive files in a repository, the custodian agent's task is to locate files relevant to the issue.
* developer: The developer's task is to actually implement files.
* qa_engineer: The QA engineer's task is to check that the implemented code actually works.

Please decompose the main task into subtasks that this team of workers can tackle in sequence.
The task list must be in the format of a markdown bullet list.
